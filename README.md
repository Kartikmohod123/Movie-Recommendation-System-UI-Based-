🎬 Movie Recommendation System
This is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and machine learning techniques. It suggests similar movies based on a selected movie's features such as genres, overview, cast, crew, and keywords.

📁 Project Overview
This project leverages the TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset, which includes information about:

Movie metadata (tmdb_5000_movies.csv)

Credits (cast and crew) (tmdb_5000_credits.csv)

Using natural language processing (NLP) and similarity techniques like cosine similarity, the model recommends movies that are contextually close to the selected one.

🔍 Features
Clean and preprocess movie and credits datasets

Combine key features like overview, cast, crew, and keywords

Vectorize text using CountVectorizer

Calculate similarity using Cosine Similarity

Simple UI for movie selection and recommendations (optional: Streamlit or Flask)

🗃 Dataset
Note:
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the datasets tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv are not uploaded directly to this repository.
